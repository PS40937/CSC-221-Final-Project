# CSC-221-Final-Project - Design Document
Step 1 - Choose what game to design (snake), this was chosen out of nostalgia.  This was the first game I had on my first cell phone.
Step 2 - Start researching how to do this
Step 3 - Install pygame through command line interface
Step 4 - Open Python and begin coding
Step 5 - Import needed libraries (random, time, & pygame)
Step 6 - This is where I started to run into issues as I was unsure of how to proceed with the coding.  I did some research online and found suggestions for coding along with the explanations of those commands.
Step 7 - Absorb as much information as possible to provide the optimum experience for the end-user.
Step 8 - Initiate pygame - pygame.init()
Step 9 - I found that I can choose the colors used within the game by selecting the RBG denominations (0-255).  To choose the colors exactly, I opened Microsoft Excel and used the "Fill Color" function, choosing to customize the color and take the resuts of the colors chosen and apply them to my game.  An example is the blue that I chose - (67, 94, 255).  Unsure of how many colors will be needed, I am starting with 5.
Step 10 - Next I am choosing the screen size for the game board.  As the game develops I will come back to this and make adjustments as needed.  Initally I am going with a width of 500 pixels and a length of 300 pixels.
Step 11 - Choosing and inserting the game title into the coding (CSC-221 Final Project - The Snake)
Step 12 - Design the snake and the speed at which it will move.  Again, similar to the screen size and colors, I am unsure where this will land in the end so I will come back to it and make adjustments as needed once the game is developed.
Step 13 - Choosing the font and font size to be displayed for the score and other features within the game.  For this I opened Microsoft word to browse through the selections available and to ensure I used the correct spelling within Python.  I've chosen Cooper Black & Comic Sans as my fonts just because I like the way they look. :)
Step 14 - This is where I ran into much confusion as I have no idea how to define the rules surrounding the game
